        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Hello there, my name is Prime Coder! I am a programming  enthusiast,<br> spending my time making 3D Video Games, websites, and apps</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>My Skills:</b></p>

                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I am a huge coding/programming hobbyist. I don't do coding professionally, but rather as a hobby. I do a lot of coding in my spare time and in fact, I coded this whole website myself! I have been coding for a long time and still continue to do so and I plan to never stop! I code in mainly C# and Python.</p>

                <h1>Video Game Development</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I started with video game development, quite recently. I found interest in it as it had a huge chunk of it to do with programming. I also found a way to unleash my creative inner self in a fun and happy way by making games. I could create any thing I wanted and I was only bounded by my imagination. I use the Unity Game Engine for game development.</p>

            <div data-tilt class="card3">
                <h1>Video Editing/VFX</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I would watch movies all the time and would see all sorts of things like massive explosions, or a big gun fight sequence. I just couldn't help myself but wonder, how did they do that? I searched it up and realized that I myself could pull off something like this that would not be as good as the one in the movies but would look somewhat good. I use DaVinci Resolve for video editing and Blender 3D for VFX.</p>

                    proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank

                    hold with such nonsense.
                    Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
                    made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
                    and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which
                    came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
                    garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small
                    son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
                    The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
                    secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.</p>
